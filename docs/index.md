# Introduction

Welcome to -Keitaro's requests site documentation! This place will give you all the information you need to use (and/or develop) the requests site.

## Information

Requests site is a simple site made by [-Keitaro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3378391) for easier and managable request handling.  
It was made with simplicity in mind and attempts to be as easy to use as possible to everyone.  
Although it was first made for only -Keitaro himself, it was changed so that other nominators could use it too.

!!! note
    If you are a Beatmap Nominator and is interested in joining, please look at [this page](nominator).
