# Nominator Documention

Here, you will find most information needed as a nominator.

## Becoming a nominator

If you're interested in becoming a nominator, here are the requirements you will have to do:

* You need to be able to write rejection reason for *every single request*. You heard it right, **all of them**. *Well technically you can leave it empty but it really defeats the purpose of the site*.

That's all! If you're willing to do that, feel free to shoot -Keitaro a PM!

## Setting up

Upon becoming a nominator in this set, you will see a new item in navigation bar, ooh!

By default, you're closed to prevent people asking for requests when you're not setted up yet.  
Please fill in at least your rules so that it is not left default.

As for the rest, here are some explanations:

* **Closed**: Whether you are closed for requests or not.
* **Allow multiple reqs**: Whether you allow people to request multiple requests or not.
* **Show rejected maps**: Whether you want your rejection to be able for public or not.
* **Rules**: ...duh.
* **Notice**: The message that will be put on in your request listing page.
* **Show notice**: Whether to show your notice or not, if Notice is empty and this option is ticked, it will still not show any notice. *(Well, what are we trying to show anyway if it's empty?!)*

For Rules and Notice field, you may use markdown to spice up your text.

## Additional notes

Once you become a BN, a webhook will be added in -Keitaro's server for any events happening related to you.
