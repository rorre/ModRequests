# Requester Documentation

Here, you will find most information needed as a requester/user.

## Requesting

Well, you are here (most likely) to request a mod, so... let's go and look at how to request!  

!!! warning
    Javascript is required in this step.

!!! warning
    You have to be logged in in order to request.

* First of all, upon reaching the request list page, click over "Request Mod" in the navigation bar.

* Then, link your map in `Mapset URL` field and wait until it's done loading.

!!! info
    If it doesn't want to load, try removing and typing the last character of your URL.  
    This often affects mobile users.

* Feel free to add note, and select the nominator. **Make sure they don't have closed mark on their name.**
* After you're done, click on `Submit`.

## Cancelling Request

Sometimes, you just want to cancel your request for whatever reason. Whether you already found 2 BNs, simply just don't want to push the map, or the BN just suck ass. You can do that easily with one button.

In your request card, you will see `Cancel Request` button, just click there and poof, your request is gone! *(Don't worry there will be a confirmation popup)*

## No reason provided?

Although it is against the site's idea to not have rejection reason, you should ask your nominator as to why you reject it. Though...you're free to just move on.

## Further question?

Feel free to PM -Keitaro if you're confused about something.
